PAEDIATRIC CONDITIONS APP: INSTALL AND PUBLISH GUIDE

WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER
index.html            the whole app (all content is inside this one file)
sw.js                 makes it work offline
manifest.webmanifest  lets phones install it like an app
icon-192.png, icon-512.png, apple-touch-icon.png   app icons (placeholders, replace with your own)

1. PUT IT ONLINE (needed once, requires https)
Upload the whole folder to any free static host, for example:
 - Netlify Drop (app.netlify.com/drop): drag the folder onto the page
 - Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages
You get a web address. Open it once on a phone WITH internet so the app saves itself.

2. INSTALL ON A PHONE
Android (Chrome): menu (three dots) > Install app / Add to Home screen.
iPhone (Safari only): Share button > Add to Home Screen.
After the first visit it opens and works with no signal.

3. UPDATING THE CONTENT
After any change to index.html, open sw.js and change 'paeds-v1' to 'paeds-v2' (then v3, and so on), then upload the folder again. Phones update the next time they open the app with internet.

4. STORES (later)
Google Play: go to pwabuilder.com, enter your web address, download the Android package. Needs a Play developer account ($25 once).
Apple App Store: needs a $99/year developer account, a Mac with Xcode, and a native wrapper. Apple may reject apps that are only a website, so it needs more app-like features.

5. BEFORE PUBLISHING WIDELY
 - Get written permission from the EDLIZ owners.
 - Check Zimbabwe regulations for software that calculates doses.
 - Have a clinician verify every dose against the print.
 - The source and disclaimer wording on each page should be reviewed.
